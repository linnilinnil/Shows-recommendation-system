Ever spend over half an hour trying to look for a good show, or movie to watch on the weekend? Ever feel like none of the tiktok videos or spotify daily recommendations are interesting enough to keep you on the app? It is probably because the platforms' "recommendation systems" are not performing well to suggest content that suits your tastes. Reommendation systems suggest content that you might like based on your previous selections and overall user profile, and are tools pivotal to many entertainment&streaming services.
